**SVARAG** (Sentiment-Aware Voice-Activated Retrieval-Augmented Generation Chatbot) is an advanced AI system designed to process voice queries, analyze sentiment, retrieve relevant information, and generate responses with an appropriate tone. By integrating speech recognition, sentiment analysis, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and text-to-speech (TTS), SVARAG provides a conversational AI experience that is both contextually aware and emotionally intelligent.

## 🔑 **Key Features**

🎙️ **Voice-Activated Query Processing**

- Users can upload or record audio to interact with the chatbot.
- Uses Whisper for speech-to-text transcription.

🧠 **Multimodal Sentiment-Aware Responses**

- Extracts vocal features (pitch, volume, articulation rate) and generates natural language descriptions of the audio.
- Passes both the audio description and transcribed text to an LLM to determine the appropriate Tone Instructions for the final response.
- Ensures responses are emotionally aligned and contextually relevant based on both speech characteristics and text content.

🔎 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Intelligent Responses**
- Retrieves relevant information from uploaded documents.
- Uses hybrid search: vector-based retrieval (ChromaDB) + keyword-based search (BM25).
- Generates factually accurate, context-aware responses using Mistral-7B LLM.

🔊 **Realistic Text-to-Speech (TTS) Output**
- Converts responses into natural-sounding speech using XTTS-v2.
- Ensures smooth, expressive voice synthesis for a conversational experience.

⚡ **Fast & Seamless User Experience**
- Built with Streamlit for an intuitive web interface.
